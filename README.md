# Incentive-Legal-Services
This project proposes an incentive-based framework for onboarding legal service providers such as Advocates, Mediators, Notaries and Document Writers onto a digital eMarketplace to extend affordable and citizen-centric legal services in India. The project contributes towards strengthening access to justice under the Digital India mission.
